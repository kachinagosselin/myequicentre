<h1> How it Works </h1>
<h3>

</h3>

<h3>
If you are looking to sell your horses using MyEquiCentre you need to sign up for a free
account. You will be redirected to your own private dashboard where you can create your own
horse listings. When listings are initially created they are inactive and you have to enter
your credit card information and pay for the listing before it can be activated.
</h3>

<h3>
Once your account is activated
