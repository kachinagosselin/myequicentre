<h4>Leave testimonials and share</h4>
<h3>
If you're in communication with the horse owner then it means we trust your opinion when
it comes to leaving a testimonial for the next person to view the horse. So if you're a 
friend, neighbor or just visited the horse leave a note for interested viewers. If you 
know what horses you like we make it easy for you to share horses via Facebook, 
Twitter and even Pinterest.

your area have joined onto the site. Go out and meet them! Start discussions, make 
friends and build community. Together we can make MyEquiCentre the place to go to stay in 
touch with your barn buddies, you know, when it's too cold to trek out to the barn!

<h4>Best ads rise to the top</h4>
<h3> 
We don't allow horse owners to pay for their listings to get more visibility on the site 
(with exception of the slideshow on the homepage). Instead we subtly encourage owner 
transparency by giving preferance to horses that have a detailed pedigree and competition 
record filled out thus making sure that you get in-depth knowledge on the horses you find.

<h4>Find serious inquirers</h4>
<h3>
As a horse owner you need to balance attracting attention and time spent.
We enable you to create custom surveys so that you can identify serious inquirers
before sharing your contact information.

<h4>MyEquiCentre iPhone App</h4>

We envision down the road having an iphone app that gives your alerts about new users and 
horses being listed that are in your neighborhood. You'll never even have to go online to 
conduct your horse search - the best horses will come to you!
